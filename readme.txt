Overrides the standard WordPress gallery with a film-strip style one.

== Description ==

SP Gallery overrides existing [gallery] shortcodes in WordPress posts and pages and adds a few much-needed options to the existing WordPress gallery functions.

== Installation ==

Usage is simple:

1. Upload images as you normally would to any WordPress post.
2. Optionally, you may use the new "show in gallery" option to hide and display individual images.
3. Add the [gallery] shortcode to your post. 

It's really that easy. S&P Gallery also has some options built-in to customize the way your gallery is displayed.

1. On the SP Gallery admin page you may customize the image sizes.
2. Use [gallery id="some-post-id"] to display a gallery from a different post.
3. Use [gallery order="DESC"] to reverse the order images are displayed in.
4. Or use orderby to change which fields the images are arranged by.
